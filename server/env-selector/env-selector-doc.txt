Environment and Application configuration Selector
--------------------------------------------------

Each selection is of the form:

   {Environment}_{ProxyType}[_{Minify}]

Environments: dev, qa, demo, stage, uat, prod

ProxyTypes:
   mocks - Will only hit Mock API.
   live  - Will only hit Live API.
   mixed - Will hit a combination of Mock and Live API depending on
           mockRegex matching. See server/config/env/dev.js for more.
Minify:
   min - (Optional) Code will be minified.

===NOTES===
 - Not all combinations are listed. To add one that is not listed,
   see taskConfig.env in Gruntfile.js.

 - This list is sorted by environment and then alphabetically.
   Keep in mind that if new entries are added, the selection
   numbers could change!
